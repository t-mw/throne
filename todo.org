*** TODO syntax to match rule only once per update / permanently. or even make matching once per update the default.
  - option to scope permanence by a variable
  - #stage: { input 3= output } evaluates max 3 times within stage, becomes:
    #stage: {
        // must be structured to keep behavior of random rule selection
        !tmp-counter-123 _ . input = output . tmp-counter-123 2
        tmp-counter-123 N . > N 0 . - N 1 N' . input = output . tmp-counter-123 N'
        () = #tmp-cleanup
    }
    #tmp-cleanup: { tmp-counter-123 _ = () }
  - could also allow integer variables to be used instead of constant e.g. #stage: { $count N . input N= output }
*** TODO lispy key properties to enable pattern matching or syntax sugar for getting + modifying values by key in a record of form (record (k1 v1) (k2 v2) ...)
    e.g to modify player (name N) (x 10) (y 20)
    // This rule...
    player :x X . + X 1 X' = player :x X'
    // ...would be syntactic sugar for:
    player ...O1 (x X) ...O2 . + X 1 X' = player ...O1 (x X') ...O2
    // if there’s more than one ‘player’ on each side of the rule the verbose syntax is needed to disambiguate.
    // NB: the ... proposal doesnt handle multiple unordered properties well
*** TODO make $ remove instead of preserve, since remove is less common and this makes the stage behavior (#asdf:) consistent with other syntax 
*** TODO support custom backwards predicate (<<) under stage label
*** TODO decide on consistent syntax for arguments e.g. keywords?
*** TODO arbitrary math expressions e.g. 'expr 2 + A / 3 + 1.5 = B'
*** TODO replace !== backwards predicate with ability to use '!' anywhere in a phrase e.g. !== A B would become == A !B
*** TODO ability to arbitrarily nest 'stage' scopes
*** TODO ability to put rule output in 'stage' scopes e.g. in1 . in2 = out1 { subset = () } === in1 . in2 . subset = out1
*** TODO ability to put state in 'stage' scopes e.g. #stage { some-state } becomes #stage . !some-state = some-state
*** TODO reduce serialization boilerplate with either serde or generated code (like with pest)
*** TODO allow output in custom backwards predicate, i.e. output is appended to rule
*** TODO test doing initial matching through ecs instead of first atoms (e.g. https://github.com/TomGillen/legion)
  - requires a macro to generate rust structs for throne identifiers
  - an item of state is then e.g. &[FooAtom::N1, Var::N2, BarAtom::N3, etc..]
  - possible matching rules are found using a component query
*** TODO support marking state phrases immutable in debug builds, logging warning when the state is consumed by a rule. or do compile-time check.
*** TODO support matching phrases while binding to them, to avoid retyping them in output e.g. (foo A)@FOO . bar = FOO
*** TODO look at prolog optimizations
    - could we compile each rule down to a specialized routine with a stack for variable matches to replace test_inputs_with_permutation
    - bin each phrase by (atom, atom position) and variable name to speed up matching
*** TODO add syntax for matching on const lists i.e. (FOO | BAR) matched against (a b c): FOO = a, BAR = (b c)
*** TODO ink -> throne converter
*** TODO syntax for inserting the result of an input match directly into output
  - e.g.   foo FOO = `foo capitalized is` (^capitalize FOO <OUT)
         instead of
           foo FOO . ^capitalize FOO OUT = `foo capitalized is` OUT
         where OUT can also be a wildcard (or omitted?)
*** TODO evaluate constant expressions to eliminate rules that will never match
*** TODO an easy way to test a rule with a chance of success based on a probability extracted from state
  - This is currently difficult since the number of times that a rule may be evaluated in an update is not well defined
*** DONE use const generics to replace find_phrases* and find_phrases_exactly* variants with single function
    CLOSED: [2021-07-19 Mon 17:43]
  - e.g. `find_phrases<const N: usize>(pattern: [Option<&Atom>; N], match_pattern_length: bool) -> Vec<&[Token]> { ... }`
  - replace find_phrase* variants too
*** TODO measure performance with https://github.com/bodil/smartstring
*** TODO add examples
    - [X] Conway's game of life
    - [ ] Chess
    - [ ] Tic tac toe
    - [ ] Procedural generationn
*** TODO test with https://github.com/yuulive/mo
*** TODO reduce permutation space beyond first atom
    - a X . a X = ... or a X . b X = ... with a (0..N) and b (0..N) triggers an O(N^2) search on each update.
*** TODO support backwards predicates in any order
    - currently backwards predicates are evaluated left to right in two passes, so > 2 backwards predicates in the wrong order will fail matching e.g. + C 3 D . % B 2 C . + A 1 B = ...
    - backwards predicates need to be evaluated in order based on variable dependencies.
    - could extend ordering based on dependencies to matching in general, including side predicates and normal state matches, to reduce permutations.
*** TODO optimization ideas
    - execute from a match plan instead of rebuilding concrete rules
      - matching would return matched state indices + variable bindings + output phrases.
      - then execute directly, instead of rebuilding phrases and matching/removing them again.
    - track which rules are affected by recent state changes and only re-check those.
    - replace permutation walk with constraint/backtracking search
      - pick the next input with the smallest candidate set first.
      - propagate variable bindings early so dead branches fail fast.
    - compile a static per-rule match plan once
      - pre-split inputs into concrete/var/backwards/side/negated buckets.
      - precompute variable occurrence/dependency maps used during matching.
    - rete-like incremental matcher
*** TODO try https://twitter.com/tomaka16/status/1391052081272967170
    - "you might be able to save a lot of hashmap lookups if you replace a `HashMap<K, V>` with a `HashMap<K, usize>` and a `Slab<V>`. This might be very useful if K is something heavy such as a `String`"
*** DONE support quiescence rule under stage label i.e. don't copy left-hand stage for quiescence rule
    CLOSED: [2021-04-30 Fri 11:16]
*** DONE replace #foo -> stage foo, because # does not have special effects like other symbols
    CLOSED: [2021-04-29 Thu 15:24]
*** DONE syntax for scheduling some output of a rule to be deleted at the end of the update
    CLOSED: [2021-05-08 Sat 03:24]
    - left up to embedder.
*** DONE make () = () optional in prefixed blocks
    CLOSED: [2021-05-04 Tue 19:55]
*** DONE detect infinite loops
    CLOSED: [2021-05-03 Mon 13:17]
*** DONE selectively disable warnings
  CLOSED: [2020-01-24 Fri 14:24]
*** DONE wildcard variable: _
*** DONE support defining own backwards predicates:
  - defined as rule without '=': <test A B . + A B C . required state C
  - can be compiled by replacing instances of <test _ _ in the full rule, making the appropriate variable name substitutions
  - predicate does not consume state, which needs a small change in the matching loop
*** DONE comment syntax
*** DONE syntax to check absence of state: ^
*** DONE move drawing outside of rules - just draw with js by iterating over state
*** DONE handle frames by 'injecting' atom i.e. insert '#frame' atom and let rules handle it
*** DONE 'derived' state i.e. able to match on Z where Z is equivalent to X + Y, when only X + Y are present
*** DONE performance improvement by sorting states by atom indices + jumping to known ranges during matching or do binary search
*** DONE modulo
*** DONE improve performance by, for each phrase in a rule, recording the states that could match the phrase. needs to be re-evaluated each time state is added or removed.
  - attempted in 7d27586, worsened performance.
