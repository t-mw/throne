*** TODO support custom backwards predicate (<<) under stage label
*** TODO decide on consistent syntax for arguments e.g. keywords?
*** TODO arbitrary math expressions e.g. 'expr 2 + A / 3 + 1.5 = B'
*** TODO option to only process a variable once per stage
*** TODO lispy key properties to enable pattern matching
*** TODO syntax to match rule only once per update / permanently. or even make matching once per update the default.
  - option to scope permanence by a variable
*** TODO make $ remove instead of preserve, since remove is less common and this makes the stage behavior (#asdf:) consistent with other syntax
*** TODO replace !== backwards predicate with ability to use '!' anywhere in a phrase
*** TODO ability to arbitrarily nest 'stage' scopes
*** TODO ability to put rule output in 'stage' scopes e.g. in1 . in2 = out1 { subset = () } === in1 . in2 . subset = out1
*** TODO reduce serialization boilerplate with either serde or generated code (like with pest)
*** TODO allow output in custom backwards predicate, i.e. output is appended to rule
*** TODO test doing initial matching through ecs instead of first atoms (e.g. https://github.com/TomGillen/legion)
  - requires a macro to generate rust structs for throne identifiers
  - an item of state is then e.g. &[FooAtom::N1, Var::N2, BarAtom::N3, etc..]
  - possible matching rules are found using a component query
*** TODO support marking state phrases immutable in debug builds, logging warning when the state is consumed by a rule. or do compile-time check.
*** TODO support matching phrases while binding to them, to avoid retyping them in output e.g. (foo A)@FOO . bar = FOO
*** TODO look at prolog optimizations
    - could we compile each rule down to a specialized routine with a stack for variable matches to replace test_inputs_with_permutation
    - bin each phrase by (atom, atom position) and variable name to speed up matching
*** TODO add syntax for matching on const lists i.e. (FOO | BAR) matched against (a b c): FOO = a, BAR = (b c)
*** TODO ink -> throne converter
*** TODO syntax for inserting the result of an input match directly into output
  - e.g.   foo FOO = `foo capitalized is` (^capitalize FOO <OUT)
         instead of
           foo FOO . ^capitalize FOO OUT = `foo capitalized is` OUT
         where OUT can also be a wildcard (or omitted?)
*** TODO evaluate constant expressions to eliminate rules that will never match
*** TODO an easy way to test a rule with a chance of success based on a probability extracted from state
  - This is currently difficult since the number of times that a rule may be evaluated in an update is not well defined
*** TODO use const generics to replace find_phrases* and find_phrases_exactly* variants with single function
  - e.g. `find_phrases<const N: usize>(pattern: [Option<&Atom>; N], match_pattern_length: bool) -> Vec<&[Token]> { ... }`
  - replace find_phrase* variants too
*** TODO measure performance with https://github.com/bodil/smartstring
*** TODO add examples
    - [X] Conway's game of life
    - [ ] Chess
    - [ ] Tic tac toe
    - [ ] Procedural generationn
*** TODO test with https://github.com/yuulive/mo
*** TODO reduce permutation space beyond first atom
    - a X . a X = ... or a X . b X = ... with a (0..N) and b (0..N) triggers an O(N^2) search on each update.
*** TODO support backwards predicates in any order
    - currently backwards predicates are evaluated left to right in two passes, so > 2 backwards predicates in the wrong order will fail matching e.g. + C 3 D . % B 2 C . + A 1 B = ...
    - backwards predicates need to be evaluated in order based on variable dependencies.
    - could extend ordering based on dependencies to matching in general, including side predicates and normal state matches, to reduce permutations.
*** DONE support quiescence rule under stage label i.e. don't copy left-hand stage for quiescence rule
    CLOSED: [2021-04-30 Fri 11:16]
*** DONE replace #foo -> stage foo, because # does not have special effects like other symbols
    CLOSED: [2021-04-29 Thu 15:24]
*** DONE syntax for scheduling some output of a rule to be deleted at the end of the update
    CLOSED: [2021-05-08 Sat 03:24]
    - left up to embedder.
*** DONE make () = () optional in prefixed blocks
    CLOSED: [2021-05-04 Tue 19:55]
*** DONE detect infinite loops
    CLOSED: [2021-05-03 Mon 13:17]
*** DONE selectively disable warnings
  CLOSED: [2020-01-24 Fri 14:24]
*** DONE wildcard variable: _
*** DONE support defining own backwards predicates:
  - defined as rule without '=': <test A B . + A B C . required state C
  - can be compiled by replacing instances of <test _ _ in the full rule, making the appropriate variable name substitutions
  - predicate does not consume state, which needs a small change in the matching loop
*** DONE comment syntax
*** DONE syntax to check absence of state: ^
*** DONE move drawing outside of rules - just draw with js by iterating over state
*** DONE handle frames by 'injecting' atom i.e. insert '#frame' atom and let rules handle it
*** DONE 'derived' state i.e. able to match on Z where Z is equivalent to X + Y, when only X + Y are present
*** DONE performance improvement by sorting states by atom indices + jumping to known ranges during matching or do binary search
*** DONE modulo
*** DONE improve performance by, for each phrase in a rule, recording the states that could match the phrase. needs to be re-evaluated each time state is added or removed.
  - attempted in 7d27586, worsened performance.
