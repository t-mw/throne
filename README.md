# Ideas
- wildcard variable: _
- support quiescence rule under stage label i.e. don't copy left-hand stage for quiescence rule
- decide on consistent syntax for arguments e.g. keywords?
- support defining own backwards predicates
- comment syntax
- allow hex colors / named colors to be passed directly to sprite
- add hex overload to 'color' predicate
- syntax to check absence of state: ^
- nested labels
- arbitrary math expressions e.g. 'expr 2 + A / 3 + 1.5 = B'
- move drawing outside of rules - just draw with js by iterating over state
- handle frames by 'injecting' atom i.e. insert '#frame' atom and let rules handle it
- option to only process a variable once per stage
- 'derived' state i.e. able to match on Z where Z is equivalent to X + Y, when only X + Y are present
- performance improvement by sorting states by atom indices + jumping to known ranges during matching or do binary search
- modulo
- lispy key properties
- syntax to match rule only once per update / permanently
